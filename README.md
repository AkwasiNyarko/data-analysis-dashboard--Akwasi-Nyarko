## 👨‍🏫 For Instructors

### Classroom Setup Recommendations
- **Cost per class**: $0 (using free local development)
- **Requirements**: Students need computers with Node.js installed
- **Internet**: Only needed for initial setup and deployment
- **AI Features**: Use mock responses or shared API key to minimize costs

### Minimizing Costs
1. **Use local development** for the entire course
2. **Share one OpenAI API key** among students (set spending limits)
3. **Deploy to free platforms** (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
4. **Optional**: Purchase one Lovable subscription for live demos

### Alternative Approaches
- **Mock AI responses**: Implement fake AI responses for learning without API costs
- **Offline development**: Focus on React/TypeScript without external APIs
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start free, add paid features only if budget allows

### Main App Files
- `src/App.tsx` - The main app that holds everything together
- `src/main.tsx` - Starts the React app (you won't need to change this much)
- `src/index.css` - Global styles for the whole app

### Components (UI Pieces)
- `src/components/DataUpload.tsx` - The file upload area
- `src/components/DataTable.tsx` - Shows data in a table
- `src/components/ChartSection.tsx` - Creates charts from data
- `src/components/InsightsPanel.tsx` - Shows interesting facts about data
- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - AI chat feature
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard that combines everything

### Utilities (Helper Functions)
- `src/utils/dataAnalysis.ts` - Functions that analyze and process data
