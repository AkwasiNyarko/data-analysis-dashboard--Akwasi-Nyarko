## ðŸ¤” What Each File Does

### Main App Files
- `src/App.tsx` - The main app that holds everything together
- `src/main.tsx` - Starts the React app (you won't need to change this much)
- `src/index.css` - Global styles for the whole app

### Components (UI Pieces)
- `src/components/DataUpload.tsx` - The file upload area
- `src/components/DataTable.tsx` - Shows data in a table
- `src/components/ChartSection.tsx` - Creates charts from data
- `src/components/InsightsPanel.tsx` - Shows interesting facts about data
- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - AI chat feature
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard that combines everything

### Utilities (Helper Functions)
- `src/utils/dataAnalysis.ts` - Functions that analyze and process data
- `src/types/data.ts` - TypeScript definitions for data structures

### UI Components
- `src/components/ui/` - Pre-built UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

### If the app won't start:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Check for error messages in the terminal

### If you're stuck on code:
1. Check the `HINTS.md` file for solutions
2. Look at the TODO comments in the code
3. Ask your instructor or classmates

### If you want to see a working example:
Switch to the `solution` branch to see completed features:
```bash
git checkout solution
```
