## üìö Key Concepts Explained

### What is a React Component?
Think of components like LEGO blocks:
- Each component has **one specific job**
- You can **reuse** components anywhere in your app
- You **combine** smaller components to build bigger features

**Example**: The `DataUpload` component's only job is handling file uploads.

### JSX vs HTML
JSX looks like HTML but it's actually JavaScript:

```jsx
// JSX (what we write)
<button onClick={handleClick}>Upload File</button>

// What JSX becomes (pure JavaScript)
React.createElement('button', { onClick: handleClick }, 'Upload File')
```

**Key Difference**: JSX lets you mix HTML-like syntax with JavaScript logic.

### Props (Properties)
Props are how components talk to each other:
```jsx
// Parent component passes data
<DataUpload onDataLoad={handleDataLoad} />

// Child component receives data
const DataUpload = ({ onDataLoad }) => {
  // Use the onDataLoad function here
}
```

## üìö Exercise 1: Customize Your App Title
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê Easy  
**Time:** 10 minutes

### Task
Personalize the main title in `src/pages/Index.tsx` to include your name.

### Steps
1. Open `src/pages/Index.tsx`
2. Find line 52-54 with the main title
3. Change "Plug-N-Learn" to "[Your Name]'s Data Hub"
4. Save and observe the changes in the preview

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Title displays your personal name
- [ ] Styling remains unchanged
- [ ] No console errors appear

### Learning Focus
Understanding JSX and how React renders content.

## üìö Exercise 2: Add a Personal Subtitle
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê Easy  
**Time:** 15 minutes

### Task
Add your own custom subtitle below the main description.

### Steps
1. In `src/pages/Index.tsx`, find the description paragraph (lines 56-58)
2. Add a new paragraph after it with your own message
3. Use the same styling classes: `text-lg text-slate-500 max-w-2xl mx-auto`
4. Make it personal! Example: "Built by [Your Name] - Future Data Scientist"

### Success Criteria
- [ ] New subtitle appears below the main description
- [ ] Uses consistent styling with existing text
- [ ] Appears properly centered and styled

### Learning Focus
JSX structure and CSS class application.

---

## üìö Exercise 3: Explore Component Props
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium  
**Time:** 20 minutes

### Task
Examine how the `DataUpload` component receives and uses props.

### Investigation Questions
1. What props does `DataUpload` expect? (Check the interface)
2. How is the `onDataLoad` function passed from parent to child?
3. What happens when you upload a CSV file?

### Steps
1. Open `src/components/DataUpload.tsx`
2. Find the `DataUploadProps` interface (line 21)
3. Trace how `onDataLoad` is used in the component
4. Look at how it's called in `Index.tsx` (line 121)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Can identify the prop interface
- [ ] Understand the data flow from child to parent
- [ ] Can explain what `onDataLoad` does

### Learning Focus
React props, interfaces, and parent-child communication.

## üìö Exercise 4: State Management Investigation
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium  
**Time:** 25 minutes

### Task
Analyze the state management in the main `Index` component.

### Investigation Checklist
- [ ] Identify all `useState` hooks in `Index.tsx`
- [ ] Understand what data each state variable stores
- [ ] Trace how state changes when a file is uploaded
- [ ] Find where the conditional rendering happens (data vs. no data)

### Questions to Answer
1. What are the two main pieces of state being managed?
2. What triggers the state to change?
3. How does the UI change based on state?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Can list all state variables and their purposes
- [ ] Understand the conditional rendering logic
- [ ] Can predict UI changes based on state changes

### Learning Focus
React hooks, state management, and conditional rendering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Hands-On Tasks

### Task A: Explore the File Structure
Open these files and see how they connect:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx              # Main app container
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/Index.tsx      # Homepage component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DataUpload.tsx   # File upload feature
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard.tsx    # Main dashboard
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/              # Reusable UI pieces
```

### Task B: Experiment with Styling
**Try changing colors**:
1. Look for `"blue-600"` in any file
2. Change it to `"purple-600"` or `"green-600"`
3. See what changes in your browser!
